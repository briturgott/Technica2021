It isn't just the elderly,\" Fauci said. \"It's waning to the point that you're seeing more and more people getting breakthrough infections, and more and more of those people who are getting breakthrough infections are winding up in the hospital.\u201d**\n\n>**Fauci went on to say, \"I think \u2026 that the boosting is gonna be an absolutely essential component of our response, not a bonus, not a luxury, but an absolute essential part of the program.\"**\n\n>**According to the virus expert, researchers did not \"have to time\" to do extensive studies to determine whether two doses would be better than three, as there was a pressing need to get vaccines out to people sooner rather than later, which was \"life-saving for millions of people,\" he noted.**\n\n>And as more time passes, we'll be able to see how long the boosters keep recipients protected from COVID\u2014but Fauci is optimistic. **\u201dWe don't have the proof yet\u2014the proof of the pudding will be after you get people vaccinated and boosted, and we have a greater durability of protection that doesn't wane as easily.\u201d**\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nSounds totally safe and not at all rushed or missing a ton of actual evidence on to me.

He suggested massages and then the movies. But he didn\u2019t find any place that could do massages on Friday in time. I did, but he said they were too expensive and cancelled them. He tried to book another place but booked the wrong day so he cancelled those too. At the last minute he said we could re-book the expensive place but of course they couldn\u2019t do it anymore. He also didn\u2019t get any movie tickets like he said he would. I told him I really could have used a day of quality time and felt upset that he didn\u2019t follow through on what he said he would do. He ignored me.

The ones that don\u2019t work out teach you as much as the ones that do, sometimes more. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned from relationships so far.\n\n**#1 - Codependency Maximus**\n\n* When everyone tells you a relationship is a bad idea, they\u2019re probably right.\n* If the thought of getting someone pregnant and being tied to that person terrifies you, that\u2019s a red flag worth listening to.\n* Saving someone is not the same as loving them.\n* Choosing a partner means choosing their family too.\n\n**#2 - The Friend I Should Not Have Dated**\n\n* Moving in together when things are rocky won\u2019t make it better.\n* If you don\u2019t know what your needs are, no one can meet them.\n* If you don\u2019t ask for your needs to be met, no one can meet them.\n* There are some incredibly good people you will care about a lot that you should not date. \n* Staying friends with exes will piss off A LOT of future partners. Every relationship is different, but know this is a risk.\n\n**#3 - Saying \u2018I Love You\u2019 After 3 Weeks Is A Bit Soon**\n\n* If you don\u2019t have an identity outside your relationship, you\u2019ll have to build one from scratch when it ends.\n* Standing up for yourself is never a bad thing. The right partner will respect it. The wrong partners will remove themselves from your life sooner.\n* How will you feel if the things that bother you now get worse? Being with someone for decades compounds the good as well as the bad\n\n**#4 - Long Distance Drama**\n\n* If you know on the first date that it won\u2019t become a long term thing, be honest about that.\n* Being useful is not the same thing as being loved.\n* Petty shit is a red flag. Mature people care more about you than being right.\n* Relationships should not be rushed. It takes time to get to know someone. If you rush into something you are just making an important decision with less information.\n\n**#5 - Great Teamwork But Wrong Game**\n\n* Having someone who can fight for you is good, but only if you have something worth fighting for.\n* It\u2019s okay to ask for your needs. It\u2019s not okay if stating your needs gets punished.\n* Just because it\u2019s the best relationship you\u2019ve had doesn\u2019t mean you should settle if not all your needs are met.\n* If you start dreading your time with someone or wishing you weren\u2019t with them, just end it. You\u2019re wasting both people\u2019s time by dragging it out.\n* It\u2019s not always possible, but dating people who have strong friendships means you won\u2019t have to be 100% of their support network.\n\n**Recommended reading:** If this post resonated with you, I highly recommend 7 Principles of Making Marriage Work by John Gottman. To be honest I read it when I was single. It helped me recognize some of the things I had been doing wrong, and also taught me what to do differently next time. It also showed me some warning flags so I could steer things if I saw danger signs. The authors have tens of thousands of research hours with many couples, so I\u2019d encourage you to benefit from what they learned. There\u2019s a lot of relationship patterns described in the book, you don\u2019t have to learn everything the hard way (just some things)."}, {"title": "Meanwhile, Steve Bannon Is Reminding Everyone That the Right Is Very Much Trying to Destroy Democracy", "body": ""}, {"title": "Only bots are allowed to respond to this thread.

You need to be responsible for your health by exercising regularly and eating well, you need to be responsible for your social life and ensuring you are social and maintaining friendships, you need to be responsible for everything that affects you. And I'm going to tell you how to get there.\n\n\nI see a lot of young men in particular, who are angry at the world, they think that life isn\u2019t treating them the same way it treats others.\n\n\n\u00a0And guess what\u2026It isn\u2019t.\n\n\n\u00a0Some people have far greater advantages than others, and some people are hit with terrible misfortune and suffering. And whichever end of the spectrum you are, you are responsible for your life.\u00a0\n\n\nResponsibility isn\u2019t the same as fault: It\u2019s not your fault that your parents are rich, it\u2019s not your fault your dad died. But you are responsible for how these things affect your life, you choose how you deal with them.\n\n\nSome people have lost family and consequently turned to drugs and alcohol, others have lost family and started charities or companies.\u00a0\n\n\nThere are ways to deal with every situation, some better, some worse.\n\n\nYour circumstances don\u2019t define you, your response to them does.\n\n\nI hear all the time on self-improvement forums \u201cI can\u2019t do that because\u2026\u201d\u00a0 I don\u2019t care about the because, take some fucking responsibility and find a workaround.\u00a0\n\n\nThe first step to gaining some responsibility for your life is realising that you are someone worth helping. You deserve someone to look after you and make sure you can be the best version of yourself possible. Make that person you. Recognise that responsibility isn\u2019t a negative thing, It\u2019s a privilege.\u00a0\n\n\nYou GET to be responsible for your own life.\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s incredible freeing to know that, while life may fuck you, ultimately you are responsible for your misery. You are also responsible for all of your achievements, successes and happiness.\u00a0\n\n\nSo fucking own it.\n\n\n\nThe second step is starting to act like you are responsible for your life.\n\n\nThere is no third step.\n\n\nIs your job shit? It\u2019s your responsibility to either try and make it less shit, or quit.\n\n\nDo you feel like shit? That\u2019s your responsibility to figure out why and make changes\n\n\nAre your relationships shit? Take some responsibility for it, cut people off if you need to, try harder, just know that It\u2019s your responsibility to improve them.\n\n\nIs your body shit? That\u2019s your responsibility too bozo, go for a run or something idk.\n\n\nNot sticking to your goals? Actually NOT your responsibility - I\u2019m joking, of course it is you muppet.\n\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be perfect, you just have to try.

That's what makes things bad for me, like wtf is her deal with incest? Let's take it apart piece by piece:\n\n1. The Other Boleyn Girl: George Boleyn is frequently depicted as intimately kissing both Mary and Anne Boleyn and then it's heavily, heavily implied that he has sex with Anne, his own sister. \n2. The Boleyn Inheritance: It is implied that Anne of Cleves brother has a sexual interest in her and likes to see her whipped because he gets sexual pleasure from it. Also, a 16 year old Katherine Howard tries seducing a 60 year old Thomas Howard, her UNCLE.\n3. The Queen's Fool: Teenage Elizabeth has a relationship with 40 year old Thomas Seymour, her step-father. I know it doesn't really count but it infuriates me that PG blames it on Elizabeth being a \"whore\" and not Seymour, who should be a mature man at 40.\n4. Constant Princess: Henry VIII is instantly in love with Catherine of Aragon, despite being 10 years old, and the biggest attraction of all is that his brother Arthur had her first.\n5. The White Queen/Cousin's War Series: Isabel Neville and George and Anne Neville and Richard III are all first cousins who marry which, while it could be excused, Richard III also has a sexual thing with his niece. Like wtf, the Hapsburgs and their incest are only an ocean away and we know it's a seriously bad idea when nieces and uncles get together romantically, so PG why would you do this? Are you blind to what happens when uncles-nieces reproduce together?\n6. Wideacre Trilogy: This one takes the cake for me. You have a brother and a sister having sex and reproducing two kids: a boy and a girl. Then, those two incest kids get together and reproduce again, leading to another daughter.  And nobody has any mental issues despite being the product of 2 generations of brother-sister incest. \n\nI don't care how hot it is, I cannot get past the close incest. Like, at least 4 books have cases with brother-sister incest. Has PG ever had a sibling? Cause I do and my husband does and most people with sibling's I talk to could not stand them long enough to form some kind of romantic interest in them. In my experience, nobody gets you to crazy rage faster than a sibling does.\n\nWhy is she so interested in incest?"}, {"title": "Lord Nibbler, the newest addition to my nerdy crochet collection.", "body": ""}, {"title": "It Pays to Be a Conservative Democrat Blocking Popular Legislation", "body": ""}, {"title": "Delco election official sues Donald Trump, others for backlash over false voter fraud claims", "body": ""}, {"title": "Things are going to be okay.", "body": "This year, 2021 has been a fantastic year for me.

I\u2019ve learned a lot and will forever treasure the memories and laughs shared.\n\nAs XXXXX mandates the Covid19 vaccine while presenting misleading and conflicting information, I cannot in good conscience continue to work for an organization that does not take into account the autonomy of the individual nor respect our right to an \u2018informed\u2019 consent.\n\nIn\u00a0*1984 (Book)*, the statement that 2 + 2 = 5 refers to the manipulation of truth. Winston (the protagonist) himself insists on the objectivity of truth, represented by the contrasting statement \"2 + 2 = 4.\"\n\nOrwell's warning, however, is that truth itself can be manipulated and undermined by the State.\n\nMoving forward, I can be reached on my personal cell and email XXXXX.\n\nIn conclusion, I leave you with three ideas-\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1. \"The emperor has no clothes!\"\n\nThis is a reference to a fairy tale called The Emperor\u2019s New Clothes. In it, the emperor is a vain man overly concerned with his clothes spending a lot of money on them. Two con men come to town and offer to make the best clothing ever with special properties that make the clothes invisible to those unfit for their job or those that are stupid. The emperor hires them but they make nothing at all. As people come to check on the progress, they see nothing but fear they must be stupid or unfit for their job so they shower it with praise. The emperor finally comes to see the progress and is equally afraid to admit he see\u2019s nothing. The entire kingdom eventually praises the clothing and how magnificent it is. Upon its completion and unveiling in the town square, the youngest boy in the crowd (life imitates art I guess?) \u00a0speaks out that the emperor is wearing no clothes. Everyone finally admits they see nothing either including the emperor. The lie is exposed. The emperor is now forced to pretend to march around with no clothes, parading as if he does.\n\nThe lesson is that the fear of consequences will often lead people to publicly agree to things they don\u2019t privately believe in for a variety of reasons. Furthermore, the \u201cemperor\u201d will always proudly continue the lie despite his own knowledge of the truth and being publicly outed. It is easier and less painful to tell a few more lies and look foolish than to admit being foolish. We see ridiculous art like a picture of soup hailed as genius because authority figures say so and we agree because we don\u2019t want to seem unsophisticated.\u00a0\n\nEvidence proves, or lends credibility to, a theory and yet the authorities continue to push the disproven narrative.\n\n[https://youtu.be/7Ym0u-KweN4?t=6](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2F7Ym0u-KweN4%3Ft%3D6&data=04%7C01%7CRaymond.Pichardo%40Lifespan.org%7C81459f8ff2374d33106008d977e293ba%7C3764e7d08fff4c8cbd1306c688fed784%7C0%7C0%7C637672637300730273%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=D2mxAnPRDgo9IWfrb4A7tYqsyHDr61%2BJrxaUTEwdUmQ%3D&reserved=0)\n\n2. \u201cWhen a society is predicated with a deep respect for and commitment to individual rights, the individual is king and therefore the individual is free. But when individual rights are transgressed under the pretense of public safety or the greater good, The individual turns into mere political property, which any mob, or government, or institution in power can oppress, detain, or eliminate if deemed necessary.\n\nAt times such as \\[these\\], in standing on the side of freedom we unite ourselves in spirit with all other guardians of freedom across the globe.

It's set to come out later this month in English, but I read it when it first came out in Spanish and it's probably my second favorite book written by this author(my first is probably The Feast of the Goat).  I also felt compelled to write this since some users were asking about contemporary authors who aren't just Marquez or Cervantez. In the link below, it's my second comment:\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qrtfxd/what_happened_to_russian_literature_why_we_dont/hk9sbo0/\n\nAnyways, Harsh Times is historical fiction, but it's also based on actual events that you can Vargas Llosa spent a great deal of time researching. The story takes place in Guatemala in the 50s at the time when one of its presidents wanted to turn Guatemala into a modern democracy like the US. At the time, the country was ruled in a very feudalistic manner where a few people owned most of the land and most of the population, mostly indigenous, were tied to it. In order to achieve his goal, he also needed to do land reform so that unused land could be used by these people who would become the basis for the middle class. One of the groups opposing this was the United Fruit Company who is also mentioned in One Hundred Years of Solitude. \n\nPrior to the book being released, I watched an interview where the author talked about misinformation campaigns and it's one of the reasons why he wrote this book. The United Fruit Company used their resources and money to launch a massive misinformation campaign in Guatemala and in the US to make people along with the government and CIA, believe that this president was actually a communist who wanted to turn the country into a client state of the Soviet Union. The end result is a coup supported by the US, the first of its kind in Latin America. The book focuses on various people during this time period and what happens immediately after the coup. It also features certain characters from The Feast of the Goat who were also in Guatemala during this time period as well and played an active role in what happened. \n\nI really enjoyed this book since I enjoy more historical books so I amped that others will be able to finally read it. It helped me to understand the current day Guatemala better. The end of the book was also interesting. It features an interview with one of the characters who worked with the CIA and is living somewhere in the US. After the interview, there's this mini-reflection where the VL thinks back on the events that occurred there. He also tries to make the connection between that coup and how the Cuban Revolution would eventually play out just a few years after this book takes place."}, {"title": "[WIP] I'm stitching on the bag (shopper) for the first time.
