You need to be responsible for your health by exercising regularly and eating well, you need to be responsible for your social life and ensuring you are social and maintaining friendships, you need to be responsible for everything that affects you. And I'm going to tell you how to get there.\n\n\nI see a lot of young men in particular, who are angry at the world, they think that life isn\u2019t treating them the same way it treats others.\n\n\n\u00a0And guess what\u2026It isn\u2019t.\n\n\n\u00a0Some people have far greater advantages than others, and some people are hit with terrible misfortune and suffering.

You are also responsible for all of your achievements, successes and happiness.\u00a0\n\n\nSo fucking own it.\n\n\n\nThe second step is starting to act like you are responsible for your life.\n\n\nThere is no third step.\n\n\nIs your job shit?
